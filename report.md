# Player Tracking Project Report

## 1. My Approach and Methodology

### How I Started
1. **First, I tried to understand the problem**
   - Watched the video many times
   - Looked at how players move
   - Thought about how to track them
   - Focused on the 5-second video requirement

2. **Then I set up my tools**
   - Downloaded the YOLO model they gave us
   - Installed Python and needed libraries
   - Set up my development environment
   - Made sure everything was in the right folders

3. **My step-by-step approach**
   - First tried to detect players in each frame
   - Then tried to give them IDs
   - Finally tried to keep the same IDs when they come back
   - Made sure to handle the goal event part

## 2. Techniques I Tried and Their Outcomes

### First Try: Basic Detection
- **What I did**: Used YOLO model with default settings
- **What happened**: It detected players but was very slow
- **Outcome**: Not good enough, needed improvement
- **What I learned**: Need to adjust confidence threshold

### Second Try: Better Tracking
- **What I did**: Added SORT algorithm
- **What happened**: Players kept their IDs better
- **Outcome**: Much better! But still some mistakes
- **What I learned**: How to maintain player identity

### Third Try: Making it Faster
- **What I did**: Tried to optimize the code
- **What happened**: Still slow on my computer
- **Outcome**: Learned about performance limits
- **What I learned**: Hardware matters a lot

## 3. Challenges I Encountered

### Technical Problems
1. **My Computer is Slow ðŸ˜…**
   - Old laptop with basic specs
   - No good graphics card
   - Limited memory
   - Regular hard drive

2. **Code Problems**
   - Setting up everything was hard
   - Lots of errors to fix
   - Understanding the algorithms was tough
   - Making it run faster was impossible

3. **Tracking Problems**
   - Players sometimes get mixed up
   - IDs switch when players cross paths
   - Sometimes misses players
   - Can't handle high-quality video

4. **Assignment-Specific Challenges**
   - Hard to maintain IDs during goal event
   - Players moving fast are hard to track
   - Sometimes lose track when players leave frame
   - Need better re-identification

## 4. What's Incomplete and How I Would Fix It

### What's Not Working Perfectly
1. **Speed Issues**
   - Current: 0.87 FPS (very slow)
   - Target: 30 FPS (real-time)
   - Problem: My computer is too slow

2. **Quality Issues**
   - Current: Basic tracking
   - Target: Perfect tracking
   - Problem: Need better algorithms

3. **Features I Couldn't Add**
   - Player speed tracking
   - Better graphics
   - Multiple camera support
   - Real-time analysis

4. **Assignment Requirements Not Fully Met**
   - Re-identification not perfect
   - Some ID switches during goal event
   - Not real-time processing
   - Basic visualization only

### How I Would Fix It
If I had more time and better resources, I would:
1. **Get Better Hardware**
   - A computer with a good GPU
   - More RAM
   - Faster storage
   - Better cooling

2. **Improve the Code**
   - Learn more about optimization
   - Try different tracking algorithms
   - Add more features
   - Make it more accurate

3. **Add Cool Features**
   - Player statistics
   - Better visualization
   - Multiple camera support
   - Real-time analysis

4. **Fix Assignment Requirements**
   - Better re-identification
   - More stable ID tracking
   - Faster processing
   - Better visualization

## What I Learned

### The Good Stuff
- How to use YOLO (it's pretty cool!)
- Basic video processing
- How to track objects
- Python is fun!

### The Hard Stuff
- Setting up everything was tricky
- Understanding the algorithms
- Making it run faster
- Dealing with errors

## Conclusion

This project was really interesting! I learned a lot about computer vision and tracking. It's not perfect, but I think it shows that I understand the basic concepts. The main problems were my computer being too slow and me being new to this stuff. But I'm proud of what I got working!

I know I didn't meet all the requirements perfectly, especially the re-identification part during the goal event. But I tried my best with what I had, and I learned a lot about computer vision and tracking. If I had better hardware and more time, I could make it work much better!

[Note: This is my first time doing something like this, so please be nice! ðŸ˜Š]
